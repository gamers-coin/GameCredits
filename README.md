#Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the GameCredits
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of GameCredits.

#Compiling the GameCredits daemon from source on Debian
-----------------------------------------------------
The process for compiling the GameCredits daemon, gamecreditsd, from the source code is pretty simple. This guide is based on the latest stable version of Debian Linux, though it should not need many modifications for any distro forked from Debian, such as Ubuntu and Xubuntu.

###Update and install dependencies

```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
apt-get install ntp git build-essential libssl-dev libdb-dev libdb++-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev

wget http://miniupnp.free.fr/files/download.php?file=miniupnpc-1.8.tar.gz && tar -zxf download.php\?file\=miniupnpc-1.8.tar.gz && cd miniupnpc-1.8/
make && make install && cd .. && rm -rf miniupnpc-1.8 download.php\?file\=miniupnpc-1.8.tar.gz
```
Note: Debian testing and unstable require libboost1.54-all-dev.

###Compile the daemon
```
git clone https://github.com/gamers-coin/GameCredits.git
```

###Compile gamecreditsd
```
cd gamers-coinv3/src/
make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=1 USE_QRCODE=1 USE_IPV6=1
strip gamecreditsd
```

###Add a user and move gamecreditsd
```
adduser gamecredits && usermod -g users gamecredits && delgroup gamecredits && chmod 0701 /home/gamecredits
mkdir /home/gamecredits/bin
cp ~/GameCredits/src/gamecreditsd /home/gamecredits/bin/gamecreditsd
chown -R gamecredits:users /home/gamecredits/bin
cd && rm -rf GameCredits
```

###Run the daemon
```
su gamecredits
cd && bin/gamecreditsd
```

On the first run, gamecreditsd will return an error and tell you to make a configuration file, named gamecredits.conf, in order to add a username and password to the file.
```
nano ~/.gamecredits/gamecredits.conf && chmod 0600 ~/.gamecredits/gamecredits.conf
```
Add the following to your config file, changing the username and password to something secure: 
```
daemon=1
rpcuser=<username>
rpcpassword=<secure password>
```

You can just copy the username and password provided by the error message when you first ran gamecreditsd.

Run gamecreditsd once more to start the daemon! 

###Using gamecreditsd
```
gamecreditsd help
```

The above command will list all available functions of the GameCredits daemon. To safely stop the daemon, execute GameCreditsd stop. 

#Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./gamecredits-qt_test
